        The earth is in danger!\n
        The reason is that there have appeared some monsters made by the human species that threaten with the destruction of the planet that we know.\n\n
        These monsters have been inadvertently created by all men and women from our daily acts.\n
        For a long time, we were not aware of it but every day we have made these monsters grow and now they are almost out of control and can wipe out the planet in a matter of a few years.\n\n
        They are known as Flood, Pollution, Waste, Plastic, Deforestation and Gross Energy and are the most dangerous monsters that have inhabited in our planet.\n
        The main problem is that the whole humanity isn’t united in fighting these monsters.\n\n
        Many politicians and big businessmen make a lot of money by feeding these dangerous
        beasts while trying to manipulate our minds to prevent us from doing anything about them. But there is not much time left. You and only you, with your wisdom and your acts
        can destroy them forever and thus save the planet so that it continues to be habitable for all people and animals that are still alive.
